# CS50 Python

- CS50 Python is a free online course offered by Harvard University to teach students the basics of Python.
- I have little experince of Python, so completing this course will teach me the fundementals I need to get going with larger projects.

The folders here will either contain content from either:
1. Lectures
2. Problem sets

Problem sets in this context are a set of small programs I am instructed to create after a lecture, and lectures are usually an hour video. 

* Notes from lectures may not be a complete, usable program but several lines of code created for my understanding as I was learning new concepts *
